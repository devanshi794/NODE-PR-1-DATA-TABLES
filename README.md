## 📌 Conclusion

The Book Store Management API is a RESTful backend application developed using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The project successfully implements CRUD operations for both Books and Users while following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

This project demonstrates key backend development concepts such as routing, controllers, database integration, middleware usage, and API testing. It serves as a strong foundation for understanding REST API development and can be further enhanced by adding features such as JWT authentication, password encryption, role-based access control, and deployment.

Overall, this project provides practical experience in building scalable and maintainable backend applications using modern JavaScript technologies.
